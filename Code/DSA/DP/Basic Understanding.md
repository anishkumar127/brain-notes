## What is DP ?
DP is optimized recursion

## How to identify DP?
a. Optimal Problem
b. some choice is given (multiple branches in recursion tree)


## Greedy #identify

#greedy

1. least
2. most
3. min
4. max
5. largest
6. smallest



# DP Not
sum of (n) number. in that DP will not work. ❌ 
because its already skewed tree and its already optimized.


Fibonacci branches. and choices first n-1 and then n-2 its has choices and branches so there we can use DP. ✅
