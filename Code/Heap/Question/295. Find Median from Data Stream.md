**what is median ? 
- median means are the all smaller value at left side and all the greater value is the right side. and median is between them.

**so how found median.
so maximum of the smaller value, and the minimum of the greater value.
and then divide by 2.

now right is greater then left in the size.
![](https://i.imgur.com/ARTMrI0.png)



now remove minimum value from the larger value. which is top of the heap.
and remove it and add to the smaller value circle.

like above diagram.

![](https://i.imgur.com/JmjK1Pk.png)

we added 3 into the smaller circle. because smaller contain max heap. and top of the heap is 4. and 3 is less then 4. so we added 3 into the smaller circle.

now next

leftside - rightside 
left is 4-2 = 2; which is huge difference. its can be 1. difference but not then 1.

now we remove from smaller circle max value. 4. and add into the larger circle. 
from doing this our circle is balanced.

you can see in the diagram.

now next

![](https://i.imgur.com/cjfomAp.png)


we added 8 and which side should go the 8. we check left.peek() is 3. and 8 is greater then the 3. so we added into the right circle. but our right greater circle size is greater then the left circle. and that we not gonna allow it. 
so we pop it 4. and add into the again in the left circle.
next
![](https://i.imgur.com/BiGd6xD.png)


if left and right equal. then left.peek + right.peek /2;

next
![](https://i.imgur.com/k0pdu45.png)


if left size is.  rightsize+1 then our median is the left.peek.() 

here above diagram we can see the.  left size is 4 and right size is 3. then left size greater only 1. value. then the peek element of the left size is the median.

making double. we have to do. multiply by the 1.0;

next

number coming one by one. so we don't do like added first all the elements and then check. we don't need to do that. we have to avoid that things. we need to check like. elements coming one by one and we need to check median.

```java
class MedianFinder {
    PriorityQueue<Integer> left;
    PriorityQueue<Integer> right;
    public MedianFinder() {
        left = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        right = new PriorityQueue<>();
    }
    
    public void addNum(int num) {
        if(left.size()==0 || num<=left.peek()){
            left.add(num);
        }else{
            right.add(num);
        }

        int ls = left.size();
        int rs = right.size();

        if(ls - rs ==2){
            right.add(left.remove());
        }else if(rs > ls){
            left.add(right.remove());
        }
    }
    
    public double findMedian() {
        if(left.size()==right.size()){
            return (left.peek()*(1.0) + right.peek()*(1.0))/(2.0);
        }else{
           return left.peek()*1.0;
        }
        
    }
}

/**
 * Your MedianFinder object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MedianFinder obj = new MedianFinder();
 * obj.addNum(num);
 * double param_2 = obj.findMedian();

## Approach 1 : Heaps

-   We can use a max heap on the left side to represent elements that are less than effective median, and a min-heap on the right side to represent elements that are greater than effective median.
-   After processing an incoming element, the number of elements in heaps differs utmost by 1 element. When both heaps contain the same number of elements, we pick the average of heaps root data as effective median.
-   When the heaps are not balanced, we select effective median from the root of the heap containing more elements.

**Time Complexity**

O(nlogn)

**Space Complexity**

O(n)

Below is the implementation of above approach:

**1. Java**

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    MedianFinder medianFinder = new MedianFinder();
    int n = sc.nextInt();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      String s = sc.next();
      if (s.equals("addNum")) medianFinder.addNum(sc.nextInt()); else if (
        s.equals("findMedian")
      ) System.out.println(medianFinder.findMedian());
    }
    sc.close();
  }
}

class MedianFinder {

  PriorityQueue<Integer> low, high;

  public MedianFinder() {
    low = new PriorityQueue<>();
    high = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
  }

  public void addNum(int num) {
    low.add(num);
    high.add(low.poll());
    if (low.size() < high.size()) low.add(high.poll());
  }

  public double findMedian() {
    if (low.size() == high.size()) return (
      (low.peek() + high.peek()) / 2.0
    ); else return low.peek();
  }
}
```

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
