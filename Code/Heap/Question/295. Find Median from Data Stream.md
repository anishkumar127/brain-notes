**what is median ? 
- median means are the all smaller value at left side and all the greater value is the right side. and median is between them.

**so how found median.
so maximum of the smaller value, and the minimum of the greater value.
and then divide by 2.

now right is greater then left in the size.

now remove minimum value from the larger value. which is top of the heap.
and remove it and add to the smaller value circle.

like above diagram.

![](https://i.imgur.com/JmjK1Pk.png)

we added 3 into the smaller circle. because smaller contain max heap. and top of the heap is 4. and 3 is less then 4. so we added 3 into the smaller circle.

now next

leftside - rightside 
left is 4-2 = 2; which is huge difference. its can be 1. difference but not then 1.

now we remove from smaller circle max value. 4. and add into the larger circle. 
from doing this our circle is balanced.

you can see in the diagram.

now next

![](https://i.imgur.com/cjfomAp.png)


we added 8 and which side should go the 8. we check left.peek() is 3. and 8 is greater then the 3. so we added into the right circle. but our right greater circle size is greater then the left circle. and that we not gonna allow it. 
so we pop it 4. and add into the again in the left circle.
next
![](https://i.imgur.com/BiGd6xD.png)


if left and right equal. then left.peek + right.peek /2;

next
![](https://i.imgur.com/k0pdu45.png)


if left size is.  rightsize+1 then our median is the left.peek.() 

here above diagram we can see the.  left size is 4 and right size is 3. then left size greater only 1. value. then the peek element of the left size is the median.

making double. we have to do. multiply by the 1.0;
