now at this point pq.size() greater then ladder. because ladder is 2. and pq size is 3.
below code.

now we need to

if any point bricks negative we return to that index -1;  in this case 6 index return.
and if case i am reached the end and i am not returning anything. then i need to just return the height.length-1;;


```java
class Solution {

    public int furthestBuilding(int[] heights, int bricks, int ladders) {

        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();

        for(int i=1; i<heights.length; i++){

            int diff = heights[i] - heights[i-1];

            if(diff<=0) continue;

            pq.add(diff);

            if(pq.size()>ladders){

                int min = pq.remove();

                bricks-=min;

            }

  

            if(bricks<0) return i-1;

        }

  

        return heights.length-1;

    }

}
```

# Furthest Building You Can Reach

You are given an integer N, and N integers representing the heights of buildings. There are two more integers denoting bricks and ladders.

You start your journey from building 0 and move to the next building by possibly using bricks or ladders. Find out the furthest building you can reach.

While moving between two buildings:

-   If the current building's height is greater than or equal to the next building's height, you do not need a ladder or bricks.
    
-   If the current building's height is less than the next building's height, you can either use one ladder or (h[i+1] - h[i]) bricks.
    

**Note**

Height array is 0 indexed.

### Input Format

First line contains a single integer N denoting size of height array.

Second line contains two integer bricks and ladder denoting their numbers.

Third line contains N space separated integers.

### Output Format

Print the index of furthest building you can reach (0- indexed)

### Example 1

**Input**

```
7
5 2
4 2 8 6 5 11 12
```

**Output**

```
6
```

**Explanation**

-   4 --> 2 = No cost
    
-   2 --> 8 = 1 ladder
    
-   8 --> 6 = no cost
    
-   6 --> 5 = no cost
    
-   5 --> 11 = 1 ladder
    
-   11 --> 12 =1 brick
    

we are at end of array, and we still have 3 brick left, so the answer is last index of array, i.e. 6.

### Example 2

**Input**

```
7
5 1
4 2 8 6 5 11 12
```

**Output**

```
4
```

**Explanation**

-   4 --> 2 = No cost
    
-   2 --> 8 = 1 ladder
    
-   8 --> 6 = no cost
    
-   6 --> 5 = no cost
    
-   5 --> 11 = require at least 6 brick or 1 ladder, we have none, so we can't go any further.
    

### Constraints

-   1 <= heights.length <= 10^5
    
-   1 <= heights[i] <= 10^6
    
-   0 <= bricks <= 10^9
    
-   0 <= ladders <= heights.length
