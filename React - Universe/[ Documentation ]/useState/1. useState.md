### Updating state based on the previous state 

Suppose the `age` is `42`. This handler calls `setAge(age + 1)` three times:

```js
function handleClick() {  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)}
```

However, after one click, `age` will only be `43` rather than `45`! This is because calling the `set` function [does not update](https://react.dev/learn/state-as-a-snapshot) the `age` state variable in the already running code. So each `setAge(age + 1)` call becomes `setAge(43)`.

To solve this problem, **you may pass an _updater function_** to `setAge` instead of the next state:

```
function handleClick() {  setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(42 => 43)  setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(43 => 44)  setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(44 => 45)}
```

Here, `a => a + 1` is your updater function. It takes the pending state and calculates the next state from it.

React puts your updater functions in a [queue.](https://react.dev/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates) Then, during the next render, it will call them in the same order:

1.  `a => a + 1` will receive `42` as the pending state and return `43` as the next state.
2.  `a => a + 1` will receive `43` as the pending state and return `44` as the next state.
3.  `a => a + 1` will receive `44` as the pending state and return `45` as the next state.

There are no other queued updates, so React will store `45` as the current state in the end.



#### Is using an updater always preferred?


You might hear a recommendation to always write code like `setAge(a => a + 1)` if the state you’re setting is calculated from the previous state. There is no harm in it, but it is also not always necessary.

In most cases, there is no difference between these two approaches. React always makes sure that for intentional user actions, like clicks, the `age` state variable would be updated before the next click. This means there is no risk of a click handler seeing a “stale” `age` at the beginning of the event handler.

However, if you do multiple updates within the same event, updaters can be helpful. They’re also helpful if accessing the state variable itself is inconvenient (you might run into this when optimizing re-renders).

If you prefer consistency over slightly more verbose syntax, it’s reasonable to always write an updater if the state you’re setting is calculated from the previous state. If it’s calculated from the previous state of some _other_ state variable, you might want to combine them into one object and use a reducer.

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);

  function increment() {
    setAge(a => a + 1);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Your age: {age}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        increment();
        increment();
        increment();
      }}>+3</button>
      <button onClick={() => {
        increment();
      }}>+1</button>
    </>
  );
}
```


### Updating objects and arrays in state 

You can put objects and arrays into state. In React, state is considered read-only, so **you should _replace_ it rather than _mutate_ your existing objects**. For example, if you have a `form` object in state, don’t mutate it:

```js
// 🚩 Don't mutate an object in state like this:
form.firstName = 'Taylor';
```

Instead, replace the whole object by creating a new one:

```js
// ✅ Replace state with a new object
setForm({  ...form,  firstName: 'Taylor'});
```



# Example

#### Form (object) [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#form-object "Link for this heading")

In this example, the `form` state variable holds an object. Each input has a change handler that calls `setForm` with the next state of the entire form. The `{ ...form }` spread syntax ensures that the state object is replaced rather than mutated.

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [form, setForm] = useState({
    firstName: 'Barbara',
    lastName: 'Hepworth',
    email: 'bhepworth@sculpture.com',
  });

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        First name:
        <input
          value={form.firstName}
          onChange={e => {
            setForm({
              ...form,
              firstName: e.target.value
            });
          }}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Last name:
        <input
          value={form.lastName}
          onChange={e => {
            setForm({
              ...form,
              lastName: e.target.value
            });
          }}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Email:
        <input
          value={form.email}
          onChange={e => {
            setForm({
              ...form,
              email: e.target.value
            });
          }}
        />
      </label>
      <p>
        {form.firstName}{' '}
        {form.lastName}{' '}
        ({form.email})
      </p>
    </>
  );
}

```

#### Form (nested object) [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#form-nested-object "Link for this heading")

In this example, the state is more nested. When you update nested state, you need to create a copy of the object you’re updating, as well as any objects “containing” it on the way upwards. Read [updating a nested object](https://react.dev/learn/updating-objects-in-state#updating-a-nested-object) to learn more.


```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [person, setPerson] = useState({
    name: 'Niki de Saint Phalle',
    artwork: {
      title: 'Blue Nana',
      city: 'Hamburg',
      image: 'https://i.imgur.com/Sd1AgUOm.jpg',
    }
  });

  function handleNameChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      name: e.target.value
    });
  }

  function handleTitleChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      artwork: {
        ...person.artwork,
        title: e.target.value
      }
    });
  }

  function handleCityChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      artwork: {
        ...person.artwork,
        city: e.target.value
      }
    });
  }

  function handleImageChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      artwork: {
        ...person.artwork,
        image: e.target.value
      }
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Name:
        <input
          value={person.name}
          onChange={handleNameChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Title:
        <input
          value={person.artwork.title}
          onChange={handleTitleChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        City:
        <input
          value={person.artwork.city}
          onChange={handleCityChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Image:
        <input
          value={person.artwork.image}
          onChange={handleImageChange}
        />
      </label>
      <p>
        <i>{person.artwork.title}</i>
        {' by '}
        {person.name}
        <br />
        (located in {person.artwork.city})
      </p>
      <img 
        src={person.artwork.image} 
        alt={person.artwork.title}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

# More State

### I’ve updated the state, but logging gives me the old value [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#ive-updated-the-state-but-logging-gives-me-the-old-value "Link for I’ve updated the state, but logging gives me the old value")

Calling the `set` function **does not change state in the running code**:

```
function handleClick() {  

console.log(count); // 0  

  

setCount(count + 1); // Request a re-render with 1  

console.log(count); // Still 0!  

  

setTimeout(() => {  

console.log(count); // Also 0!  

}, 5000);  

}
```

This is because [states behaves like a snapshot.](https://react.dev/learn/state-as-a-snapshot) Updating state requests another render with the new state value, but does not affect the `count` JavaScript variable in your already-running event handler.

If you need to use the next state, you can save it in a variable before passing it to the `set` function:

```
const nextCount = count + 1;
setCount(nextCount);
console.log(count);     // 0
console.log(nextCount); // 1
```

#  Next

### I’ve updated the state, but the screen doesn’t update [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#ive-updated-the-state-but-the-screen-doesnt-update "Link for I’ve updated the state, but the screen doesn’t update")

React will **ignore your update if the next state is equal to the previous state,** as determined by an [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison. This usually happens when you change an object or an array in state directly:

```
obj.x = 10;  // 🚩 Wrong: mutating existing object
setObj(obj); // 🚩 Doesn't do anything
```

You mutated an existing `obj` object and passed it back to `setObj`, so React ignored the update. To fix this, you need to ensure that you’re always [_replacing_ objects and arrays in state instead of _mutating_ them](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#updating-objects-and-arrays-in-state):

```
// ✅ Correct: creating a new object
setObj({  ...obj,  x: 10});
```

# Next
### I’m getting an error: “Too many re-renders” [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#im-getting-an-error-too-many-re-renders "Link for I’m getting an error: “Too many re-renders”")

You might get an error that says: `Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop.` Typically, this means that you’re unconditionally setting state _during render_, so your component enters a loop: render, set state (which causes a render), render, set state (which causes a render), and so on. Very often, this is caused by a mistake in specifying an event handler:

```
// 🚩 Wrong: calls the handler during render  

return <button onClick={handleClick()}>Click me</button>  

  

// ✅ Correct: passes down the event handler  

return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>  

  

// ✅ Correct: passes down an inline function  

return <button onClick={(e) => handleClick(e)}>Click me</button>
```

If you can’t find the cause of this error, click on the arrow next to the error in the console and look through the JavaScript stack to find the specific `set` function call responsible for the error.

### My initializer or updater function runs twice [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#my-initializer-or-updater-function-runs-twice "Link for My initializer or updater function runs twice")

In [Strict Mode](https://react.dev/reference/react/StrictMode), React will call some of your functions twice instead of once:


```js
function TodoList() {  

// This component function will run twice for every render.  

  

const [todos, setTodos] = useState(() => {  

// This initializer function will run twice during initialization.  

return createTodos();  

});  

  

function handleClick() {  

setTodos(prevTodos => {  

// This updater function will run twice for every click.  

return [...prevTodos, createTodo()];  

});  

}  

// ...
```

This is expected and shouldn’t break your code.

This **development-only** behavior helps you [keep components pure.](https://react.dev/learn/keeping-components-pure) React uses the result of one of the calls, and ignores the result of the other call. As long as your component, initializer, and updater functions are pure, this shouldn’t affect your logic. However, if they are accidentally impure, this helps you notice the mistakes.

For example, this impure updater function mutates an array in state:

```
setTodos(prevTodos => { 
// 🚩 Mistake: mutating state
prevTodos.push(createTodo());});
```

Because React calls your updater function twice, you’ll see the todo was added twice, so you’ll know that there is a mistake. In this example, you can fix the mistake by [replacing the array instead of mutating it](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#updating-objects-and-arrays-in-state):

```js
setTodos(prevTodos => {  

// ✅ Correct: replacing with new state  

return [...prevTodos, createTodo()];  

});
```


Now that this updater function is pure, calling it an extra time doesn’t make a difference in behavior. This is why React calling it twice helps you find mistakes. **Only component, initializer, and updater functions need to be pure.** Event handlers don’t need to be pure, so React will never call your event handlers twice.

### I’m trying to set state to a function, but it gets called instead [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#im-trying-to-set-state-to-a-function-but-it-gets-called-instead "Link for I’m trying to set state to a function, but it gets called instead")

You can’t put a function into state like this:

```js
const [fn, setFn] = useState(someFunction);  

  

function handleClick() {  

setFn(someOtherFunction);  

}
```

Because you’re passing a function, React assumes that `someFunction` is an [initializer function](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#avoiding-recreating-the-initial-state), and that `someOtherFunction` is an [updater function](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#updating-state-based-on-the-previous-state), so it tries to call them and store the result. To actually _store_ a function, you have to put `() =>` before them in both cases. Then React will store the functions you pass.

```js
const [fn, setFn] = useState(() => someFunction);  

  

function handleClick() {  

setFn(() => someOtherFunction);  

}
```


# More State

## What’s a mutation? [](https://react.dev/learn/updating-objects-in-state#whats-a-mutation "Link for What’s a mutation?")

You can store any kind of JavaScript value in state.

```
const [x, setX] = useState(0);
```

So far you’ve been working with numbers, strings, and booleans. These kinds of JavaScript values are “immutable”, meaning unchangeable or “read-only”. You can trigger a re-render to _replace_ a value:

```
setX(5);
```

The `x` state changed from `0` to `5`, but the _number `0` itself_ did not change. It’s not possible to make any changes to the built-in primitive values like numbers, strings, and booleans in JavaScript.

Now consider an object in state:

```
const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
```

Technically, it is possible to change the contents of _the object itself_. **This is called a mutation:**

```
position.x = 5;
```

However, although objects in React state are technically mutable, you should treat them **as if** they were immutable—like numbers, booleans, and strings. Instead of mutating them, you should always replace them.
