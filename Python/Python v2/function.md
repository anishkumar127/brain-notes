```python
def sum(a,b):
  sumIs = a+b;
  print(sumIs)

sum(2,2)
```




# pass in python

```python
def isPending(a,b):
  pass
```

we can pass the function in the python. if we don't need to the do something inside the function
then we can pass the function.

so no interpriter count this just skip that.
