# 1. Explicit
```python
a = "1"
b = "2"
```
 to sum and output to be 3. have to type cast. if not do type cast output will be..

``print(a+b) # 12``


after type caste output

``print(int(a)+int(b)) # 3``

# 2. Implicit

```python
a = 5
b = 5.5

print(a+b)  # 10.5

```

automatic did type casting. sum int and float and convert to float value.
