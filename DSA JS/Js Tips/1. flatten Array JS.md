In JavaScript, you can use the `flat` method to flatten an array. The `flat` method creates a new array with all the subarrays concatenated into it. Here's how to use it:


```js
const arr = [[1, 2], [3, 4, [5, 6]]]; const flattened = arr.flat(); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

# Next

The `flat` method can also be used with a depth argument to specify how many levels of nesting to flatten. For example:

luaCopy code

```js
const arr = [[1, 2], [3, 4, [5, 6]]]; const flattened = arr.flat(1); // [1, 2, 3, 4, [5, 6]]
```

In this example, we call the `flat` method with a depth argument of `1`. This means that the method will only flatten one level of nesting. The resulting `flattened` array contains all the numbers in the top-level subarrays of `arr`, but leaves the nested subarray `[5, 6]` intact.
