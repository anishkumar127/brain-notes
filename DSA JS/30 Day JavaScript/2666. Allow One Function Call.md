## Description

Difficulty: **Easy**

Given a function `fn`, return a new function that is identical to the original function except that it ensures `fn` is called at most once.

*   The first time the returned function is called, it should return the same result as `fn`.
*   Every subsequent time it is called, it should return `undefined`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: fn = (a,b,c) => (a + b + c), calls = [[1,2,3],[2,3,6]]
Output: [{"calls":1,"value":6}]
Explanation:
const onceFn = once(fn);
onceFn(1, 2, 3); // 6
onceFn(2, 3, 6); // undefined, fn was not called
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: fn = (a,b,c) => (a * b * c), calls = [[5,7,4],[2,3,6],[4,6,8]]
Output: [{"calls":1,"value":140}]
Explanation:
const onceFn = once(fn);
onceFn(5, 7, 4); // 140
onceFn(2, 3, 6); // undefined, fn was not called
onceFn(4, 6, 8); // undefined, fn was not called
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= calls.length <= 10`
*   `1 <= calls[i].length <= 100`
*   `2 <= JSON.stringify(calls).length <= 1000`


## Solution

Language: **TypeScript**

```typescript
type Fn = (...args: any[]) => any;
​
function once(fn: Fn): Fn {
  let called: boolean = false;
  return function (...args) {
    if (called) return undefined;
    called = true;
    return fn(...args);
  };
}
​
/**
 * let fn = (a,b,c) => (a + b + c)
 * let onceFn = once(fn)
 *
 * onceFn(1,2,3); // 6
 * onceFn(2,3,6); // returns undefined without calling fn
 */
​
```
```ts
type Fn = (...args: any[]) => any;

function once(fn: Fn): Fn {
  let called: boolean = false;
  return function (...args) {
    if (called) return undefined;
    called = true;
    return fn(...args);
  };
}

/**
 * let fn = (a,b,c) => (a + b + c)
 * let onceFn = once(fn)
 *
 * onceFn(1,2,3); // 6
 * onceFn(2,3,6); // returns undefined without calling fn
 */

```

```js
/**
 * @param {Function} fn
 * @return {Function}
 */
var once = function(fn) {
    let called = false;
    return function(...args){
        if(called){
            return undefined;
        }
        called = true;
        return fn(...args);
    }
};

/**
 * let fn = (a,b,c) => (a + b + c)
 * let onceFn = once(fn)
 *
 * onceFn(1,2,3); // 6
 * onceFn(2,3,6); // returns undefined without calling fn
 */

- we can't defined inside class variable as a let,const,var.

- `this` is undefined.
- we have to do some context then we can use this. method

**apply() method**

- so we will do apply method.
- and this.name over here act like person.name;

- if we pass the some parameters then we need to pass as a array. if we are using the apply method.
- second parameters in apply method accept the variable but as a array.

function once(fn: Fn): Fn {
  let called: boolean = false;
  return function (...args) {

    return fn.apply(this,args);
  };
}

/**
