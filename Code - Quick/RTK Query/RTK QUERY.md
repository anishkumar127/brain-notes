- We can also the the loader if status is `isPending`



# After Create Re Call API
- previous like we fetch 5 data.

- So for that we will use **Tags**

- the name can be anything.
- and that name we also have to pass to the endpoints as a `providesTags`

- and we also have to pass the `invalidatesTags`.
- that's will be added on createPost and when create this should do `invalidatesTags`

- basic means of this is. which api we want to call again after the create.
- so we can pass that's api tags name into invalidatetags.
