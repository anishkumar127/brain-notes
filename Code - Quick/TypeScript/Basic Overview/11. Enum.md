```ts
const AISLE = 0;

const MIDDLE = 1;

const WINDOW = 2;

  

if (seat === AISLE) {

}

  

export {};
```

- Instead of above code we can use `ENUM`

# Next

```ts
  

enum SeatChoice {

    AISLE,

    MIDDLE,

    WINDOW

}

  

const anSeat  = SeatChoice.AISLE

  

export {};
```

- So we defined our fixed choice.
- In case user come and add more option than he can easily add more option.
- They also have first varible default value is 0.

- 2nd variable is 1.

- so on order wise.

- we also can set value by our self.

```ts
enum SeatChoice {

  AISLE = 10,

  MIDDLE,

  WINDOW,

}

  

const anSeat = SeatChoice.AISLE;

  

export {};
```

# Next
```ts
enum SeatChoice {

  AISLE = "aisle",

  MIDDLE = "middle",

  WINDOW = 0,

}

  

const anSeat = SeatChoice.AISLE;

  

export {};
```
