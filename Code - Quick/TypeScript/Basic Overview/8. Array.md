- giving error because not defined the type of array.
- aslo give error if type is number and assign string.


- below code is right way to do.

```ts
const superHeros: string[] = [];

  

superHeros.push("ironman");

  

export {};
```

# Array<> 2nd way

```ts
const heroPower: Array<number> = [];
```


# Type Aliases with Array

```ts
type User = {

  name: string;

  isActive: boolean;

};

  

const allUsers: User[] = [];

  

allUsers.push({ name: "", isActive: true });
```



# Array of Array
```ts
const MLModels: number[][] = [[255, 255, 255], ""];
```

- its Give error because it's take only array of array and its should be number type.

```ts
const MLModels: number[][] = [

  [255, 255, 255],

  [232, 233, 253],

];
```
