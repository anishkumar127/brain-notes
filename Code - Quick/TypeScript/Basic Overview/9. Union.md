```ts
let score: number | string = 99;

  

score = 33;

score = "two";

  

export {};
```

# With Type Aliases

```ts
  

type User = {

  name: string;

  id: number;

};

  

type Admin = {

  username: string;

  id: number;

};

  

let anish: User | Admin;
```

# Next

```ts
  

type User = {

  name: string;

  id: number;

};

  

type Admin = {

  username: string;

  id: number;

};

  

let anish: User | Admin = {

  name: "anish",

  id: 321,

};

  

anish = { username: "an", id: 234 };
```


# Next

```ts
function getDbId(id: number | string) {

  id.toLowerCase();

}

  

getDbId(2);

getDbId("2");

```

- below code working fine.

```ts
  
function getDbId(id: number | string) {

  if (typeof id === "string") {

    id.toLowerCase();

  }

}


getDbId(2);

getDbId("2");
```

- We have to check its string of number.
- Because if we do directly then it's convert to new data type. Which will cause the error.


# With Array
```ts
const data: string[] | number[] = ["1", 2, "3"];
```

- above still not working. because of its string array or string number array.
- but we want to inside value could be number or string.
- so that's we will wrap this.

```ts
const data: (string | number)[] = ["1", 2, "3"];
```


**also can do but its not good practice.*
```ts
const data: any[] = ["1", 2, "3"];
```

# custom type 

```ts
let pi:3.14  = 3.14;

  

pi = 3.145
```

- it will Give error because we fixed the value.

# Use Cause Real Scenario

```ts
let seatAllotment: "aisle" | "middle" | "window";
seatAllotment = "aisle";
seatAllotment = "crew"
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/baXlTnq.png)


- its will give error because aeatAllotment is fixed `aisle middle window` 
- we are trying to assign `crew` so it will cause error.

**Best way**
```ts
let seatAllotment: "aisle" | "middle" | "window";
seatAllotment = "aisle";
```
