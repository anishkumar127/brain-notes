## Resolve using

```ts
let greetings = "Hello Anish";
console.log(greetings);
export {}
```

- Give error when assign number to string its doing by default.

```ts
let greetings = "Hello Anish";

  

greetings = 2;

  

console.log(greetings);

  

export {}
```

- we can also do using assign type of variable.

console.log(greetings);
