```ts
let tUser: [string, number, boolean];

tUser = [true, 226, "an"];

  

export {};
```

- its giving error because tuple follow the order.
- its useful when we deal with `api & database` from them data comes with specific order.

*this is right way to do tuple.*
```ts
let tUser: [string, number, boolean];

tUser = ["an", 226, true];

export {};
```



# Another Case

```ts
let rgb: [number, number, number] = [255, 123, 112, 0.5];
```

- Error because opacity not defined.  we are trying to add opacity 
- it will cause error.
- right way to do.

```ts
let rgb: [number, number, number] = [255, 123, 112];
```


# Tuple in Type Aliases

```ts
type User = [number, string];

const newUser: User = [112, "anish@.com"];
```


- Tuple like we are destructuring value.

# Controversial

```ts
const newUser: User = [112, "anish@.com"];
newUser[1] = "an";
```

- It's not guarantee value will not change. 
- Above example, we can see we changed value.

# Next
```ts
type User = [number, string];

  

const newUser: User = [112, "anish@.com"];

  

newUser[0] = "an";
```

- Its follow the rule. 0 index not able to re assign value string. because we set type is number.

# another case

```ts
type User = [number, string];

  

const newUser: User = [112, "anish@.com"];

  

newUser.push(true);
```

- its also giving error.
- but it was not giving error on old version of TypeScript.
