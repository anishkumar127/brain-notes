```ts
type User = {

  readonly _id: string;

  name: string;

  email: string;

  isActive: boolean;

};

  

function createCourse(u: User) {}
```

- `readonly` its special feature. when we like mongodb _id  is unique id and its we can't change only change read.
- so this feature help to do read only.
- we could not modifiy .


## Next

```ts
type User = {

  readonly _id: string;

  name: string;

  email: string;

  isActive: boolean;

};

  

let myUser: User = {

  _id: "1234",

  name: "an",

  email: "a@com",

  isActive: false,

};

  
  

myUser.email = "anish@gmail.com";

myUser._id="anish"
```

- its give error because `_id` its read only.



# Make Optional

```ts
type User = {

  readonly _id: string;

  name: string;

  email: string;

  isActive: boolean;

  credCardDetails: number;

};

  

let myUser: User = {

  _id: "1234",

  name: "an",

  email: "a@com",

  isActive: false,

};

  

myUser.email = "anish@gmail.com";

myUser._id = "anish";
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/USNmmM0.png)

- error bcause myUser not contain credCardDetails.
- and it should be optional because every user can't be credCardDetails.
- so we will make it optional.

```ts
type User = {

  readonly _id: string;

  name: string;

  email: string;

  isActive: boolean;

  credCardDetails?: number;

};

  

let myUser: User = {

  _id: "1234",

  name: "an",

  email: "a@com",

  isActive: false,

};

  

myUser.email = "anish@gmail.com";

```

- So we can do possible optional using `?`  symbol.

# Different type combine.

```ts
  

type cardNumber = {

  cardNumber: string;

};

type cardDate = {

  cardDate: string;

};

  

type cardDetails = cardNumber &

  cardDate & {

    cvv: number;

  };
```
