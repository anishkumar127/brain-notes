SQL is a standard language designed for managing data in relational database management system.

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is a standard programming language specifically designed for storing, retrieving, managing or manipulating the data inside a relational database management system (RDBMS). SQL became an ISO standard in 1987.

SQL is the most widely-implemented database language and supported by the popular relational database systems, like MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle. However, some features of the SQL standard are implemented differently in different database systems.

SQL was originally developed at IBM in the early 1970s. Initially it was called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language) which was later changed to SQL (pronounced as S-Q-L).


## What You Can Do with SQL

There are lot more things you can do with SQL:

-   You can create a database.
-   You can create tables in a database.
-   You can query or request information from a database.
-   You can insert records in a database.
-   You can update or modify records in a database.
-   You can delete records from the database.
-   You can set permissions or access control within the database for data security.
-   You can create views to avoid typing frequently used complex queries.

>**Note:** Most of relational database systems also have their own additional proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard that are available only on their system.


## What is Relational Database

A relational database is a database divided into logical units called tables, where tables are related to one another within the database. Relational database allows data to be broken down into logical, smaller, and manageable units for easier maintenance and better performance.

Tables are related to one another through common keys or fields in a relational database system, that's why even though the desired data may exist in more than one table, you can easily join multiple tables together to get combined data set using a single query.


>**Note:** SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987. Although, most SQL code is not completely portable among different database systems without adjustments.


## Setting Up Work Environment for Practicing SQL

If you have no DBMS (Database Management System) already installed on your system, you have several options to choose from. You can install a free, open-source DBMS.

MySQL is the most popular and widely supported open-source database management system. It is very easy to download and use and available for both Windows and Linux (or UNIX) operating system. You can download it freely from here [https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

You can also install SQL Server Express. It is a free version of Microsoft SQL Server which allows up to 10GB of database storage. You can download the express edition from here [https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=30438](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=30438).

Alternatively, if you're planning to develop an application with PHP and MySQL you can install WampServer or XAMPP. WampServer is a Windows web development environment. It allows you to create web applications with Apache2, PHP and a MySQL database. It will also provide the MySQL administrative tool PhpMyAdmin to easily manage your databases using a web browser.
