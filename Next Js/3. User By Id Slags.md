- Folder name going to be `users` inside `users` folder we are using one route page which is `page.tsx`
- and we want to another page and that's based on by `id` so be can use `[id]` and inside that's folder we can use again `page.tsx` file. 
- Folder name going to be `[id]`



# Not working if we want to see id

# Another Way Using Props

- we are getting some `props` inside `[id]/page.tsx` 
- and we are using `pre` tags inside `pre` tag doing `json strinfy`
- why `JSON.stringify ?` because of we want see as a Object.

- here is `orderbby` is `key` & `name` is `value`
- using `&` symbols we can add more `search queries`
