## The MongoDB Shell versus the Legacy `mongo` Shell[![](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/assets/link.svg)](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/#the-mdb-shell-versus-the-legacy-mongo-shell "Permalink to this heading")

The legacy `mongo` shell was deprecated in MongoDB 5.0 and removed in MongoDB 6.0. The new MongoDB Shell, `mongosh`, offers numerous advantages over the legacy shell. The new shell has improved:

-   compatibility with the MongoDB [Node.js](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/) driver
    
-   syntax highlighting
    
-   command history
    
-   logging
    

Some legacy methods are unavailable or have been replaced with updated methods in `mongosh`. To maintain backwards compatibility, the legacy methods that `mongosh` supports use the same syntax as the corresponding methods in the `mongo` shell.

To see the complete list of methods supported by `mongosh`, refer to: [MongoDB Shell Methods.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/reference/methods/)
