**when do count ++ their not changing the variable value.**

**count increased but still in console num++ showing only 1 count increased.**

**so issue is components re render and then this *num* re initialized to 0 when components re render**
**there comes part of useState(0) this case its save the previous value that's case it's not initialized to 0 again**

but we can do like this. below image.

**so this case what we do next.**

**we will use useRef() hook because we don't want to re render our state every time for this task.**

**also from this task our code also not working like which we want to work**

**so we useRef() hook and also useRef return Object**

**now you can see this.**

*and this*

**becuase of useRef() we are using useState and useRef bhot but when we initialized value in useRef its  not infect the initial value.** 

*any why num.current ?*
 **because useRef return the object. and object share the reference so we are using current**

**here also a catch**

**we can see something below image**

and

**its working fine num.current** 
 **because of useState also help to re render the components**
 
 *what if we remove the useState() then will useRef() able to print that value inside components or not ?*
 
 **no it will not because useRef() not re Render the components**

**above image you can see state not changing because of useState() not calling.**
**that's reason in console num.current changing the value but not changing the value inside components**

**reason is object point to memory reference and its not change state.**


**where we use this ?**
	**which things not need to display but we want to save the record of them where we will use useRef() or where when state change that's things not effect**
