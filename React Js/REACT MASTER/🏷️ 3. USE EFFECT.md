# PURE FUNCTION

![](https://i.imgur.com/VUIx37w.png)


# STILL PURE

 **BECAUSE N VALUE IN CONSANT NOT EFFECT THAT MUCH**

![](https://i.imgur.com/z1Ao0rK.png)



# BUT NOT PURE SOMETHING LIKE SIDE EFFECT.

**BECAUSE N IS GLOBAL VARIABLE AND SOMEONE CHANGE THEM AND THAT'S THING WILL EFFECT THE OUTPUT OF SUM FUNCTION.**

**N CHANGING  THEN EFFECT**

# MOUNT - MEANS FIRST RENDER.
 - FIRST TIME RENDERING CALLED - MOUNTING.


# WITH USEREF UNDERSTAND USEEFFECT

SO NOW UNDERSTAND THIS.

- when function return() then something react do and then rendering happen and its visible to browser.
- but what we are doing we are accessing the input.current.focus() and its happening before the components rendering so it will not get anything and throw the error
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/iFEwB30.png)



SO WHAT'S BEST WAY TO PUT THIS ?
- Best way to put this inside useEffect.
- because useEffect run after the rendering.

![](https://i.imgur.com/cW3Haqg.png)


- so we want to run something after the components render into browser. then we want to run something then we will use useEffect.
- and don't do everything because some things break the entire application and misbehave with apps.


# MORE ABOUT 

- IF WE WANT NOT RENDER EVERY RENDERING WE WANT TO RUN ON SEPECIF TIME.
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/qqOZXMb.png)


	 avoid this issue we will use dependency array.

now its run only first time when components render. and when something change happen in id then it will run again.


# CLEAN UP FUNCTION
![](https://i.imgur.com/sAIF8ge.png)

after deletion still working..
![](https://i.imgur.com/jKTjb5l.png)


- its still running this gone from dom and browser but react don't know its gone.
- so its called the memory loss. we are doing memory waste.

so for remove this issue

we need to pass the return function
![](https://i.imgur.com/KhDiVTK.png)


it's like above what we did ? we did setInterval so we need to do opposite of this. we need to remove this.

- SET INTERVAL RETURN A ID.
- ITS PART TO DOM.
- AND THAT'S ID WILL BE UNIQUE.

![](https://i.imgur.com/cY8dK7j.png)


SO IT'S RETURN IDX AND WE DO CLEARINTERVAL AND PASS THAT ID INTO CLEARINTERVAL.
AND THIS ID WILL BE UNIQUE.

- one issue also resolve from this. it's not run 2 times. like strict mode react do 2 times render in development mode.
- so this case will not do 2 time.
- but it's inside console something its happening 2 time but clearInterval doing cleanup.
- so it's working fine now.

- now only video 1 is running again and again. previous after remove they also are removed from react.
- 
- so this time of cleaner function help to clean the garbage memory.
- example we use event listener we do like fire. on click and then its' keep doing fire because we are forget to clear that event behavior.


# API

#api

https://mockapi.io/projects



# for api calls

![](https://i.imgur.com/If0rBSy.png)



- we put handleclick button and then inside that onclick that handle click button we call apis.
- also put that handleclick inside useEffect for that's this function called automatically when first render happen.
- because useEffect call after the 1st render done.
- and we add only [] empty dependency because we want to run only 1 time after the render happen.


# more issue edit and delete not working

![](https://i.imgur.com/nCSbz1K.png)


- because previous we are doing via useReducer.
- and now we created useState. and we created a copy of that things. so that's reason its not working.

# So we Use now Reducer for avoid issue.

![](https://i.imgur.com/S53G0jr.png)


- but here also a issue because we didn't make a functionality to add directly 10 video at a time.
- because previous we are adding one by one.
- in this case video load by api at one time 10 videos.
- so we need to create the separate functionality.

# 1. 
![](https://i.imgur.com/mI2BRlw.png)

- so first we do blank array. because we don't want to initial data when render first time. 
- we want data come from backend.
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Xe7UB1j.png)


# 2.
![](https://i.imgur.com/AXjv4kE.png)

- assume we are getting previous video using ...videos.
- but this case we are getting video from api wo we don't need copy previous.
- because we are going to first time rendering.
- and also we don't need to video length because that's video id we are getting from backend api.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZIv36Uq.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/8Y0Vfm6.png)


- so we load whole array at first time rendering done. that's everything we will get from backend.
