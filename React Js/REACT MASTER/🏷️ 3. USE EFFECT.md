# PURE FUNCTION

# STILL PURE

 **BECAUSE N VALUE IN CONSANT NOT EFFECT THAT MUCH**

# BUT NOT PURE SOMETHING LIKE SIDE EFFECT.

**BECAUSE N IS GLOBAL VARIABLE AND SOMEONE CHANGE THEM AND THAT'S THING WILL EFFECT THE OUTPUT OF SUM FUNCTION.**

**N CHANGING  THEN EFFECT**

# MOUNT - MEANS FIRST RENDER.
 - FIRST TIME RENDERING CALLED - MOUNTING.


# WITH USEREF UNDERSTAND USEEFFECT

SO NOW UNDERSTAND THIS.

- when function return() then something react do and then rendering happen and its visible to browser.
- but what we are doing we are accessing the input.current.focus() and its happening before the components rendering so it will not get anything and throw the error
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/iFEwB30.png)



SO WHAT'S BEST WAY TO PUT THIS ?
- Best way to put this inside useEffect.
- because useEffect run after the rendering.

- so we want to run something after the components render into browser. then we want to run something then we will use useEffect.
- and don't do everything because some things break the entire application and misbehave with apps.


# MORE ABOUT 

- IF WE WANT NOT RENDER EVERY RENDERING WE WANT TO RUN ON SEPECIF TIME.
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/qqOZXMb.png)


	 avoid this issue we will use dependency array.

now its run only first time when components render. and when something change happen in id then it will run again.


# CLEAN UP FUNCTION

after deletion still working..
![](https://i.imgur.com/jKTjb5l.png)


- its still running this gone from dom and browser but react don't know its gone.
- so its called the memory loss. we are doing memory waste.

so for remove this issue

we need to pass the return function
![](https://i.imgur.com/KhDiVTK.png)


it's like above what we did ? we did setInterval so we need to do opposite of this. we need to remove this.

- SET INTERVAL RETURN A ID.
- ITS PART TO DOM.
- AND THAT'S ID WILL BE UNIQUE.

![](https://i.imgur.com/cY8dK7j.png)


SO IT'S RETURN IDX AND WE DO CLEARINTERVAL AND PASS THAT ID INTO CLEARINTERVAL.
AND THIS ID WILL BE UNIQUE.

- one issue also resolve from this. it's not run 2 times. like strict mode react do 2 times render in development mode.
- so this case will not do 2 time.
- but it's inside console something its happening 2 time but clearInterval doing cleanup.
- so it's working fine now.

- now only video 1 is running again and again. previous after remove they also are removed from react.
- 
- so this time of cleaner function help to clean the garbage memory.
- example we use event listener we do like fire. on click and then its' keep doing fire because we are forget to clear that event behavior.
