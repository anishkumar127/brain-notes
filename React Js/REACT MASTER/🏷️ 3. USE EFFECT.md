# STILL PURE

 **BECAUSE N VALUE IN CONSANT NOT EFFECT THAT MUCH**

# BUT NOT PURE SOMETHING LIKE SIDE EFFECT.

**BECAUSE N IS GLOBAL VARIABLE AND SOMEONE CHANGE THEM AND THAT'S THING WILL EFFECT THE OUTPUT OF SUM FUNCTION.**

**N CHANGING  THEN EFFECT**

SO NOW UNDERSTAND THIS.

- when function return() then something react do and then rendering happen and its visible to browser.
- but what we are doing we are accessing the input.current.focus() and its happening before the components rendering so it will not get anything and throw the error

SO WHAT'S BEST WAY TO PUT THIS ?
- Best way to put this inside useEffect.
- because useEffect run after the rendering.

- so we want to run something after the components render into browser. then we want to run something then we will use useEffect.
- and don't do everything because some things break the entire application and misbehave with apps.


# MORE ABOUT 

- IF WE WANT NOT RENDER EVERY RENDERING WE WANT TO RUN ON SEPECIF TIME.

	 avoid this issue we will use dependency array.

now its run only first time when components render. and when something change happen in id then it will run again.


# CLEAN UP FUNCTION
