# useImperativeHandle

`useImperativeHandle` is a React Hook that lets you customize the handle exposed as a ref.

- Its used to we want to give only some part of reference.
- we don't want to give all the reference.
- so we will not pass the same ref.
- we will pass the ref which is made from imperativeHandle.
